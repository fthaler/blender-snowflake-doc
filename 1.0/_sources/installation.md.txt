# Installation

Download the add-on zip-file from [Gumroad](https://fthaler.gumroad.com) or [Blendermarket](https://blendermarket.com/creators/fthaler).
Do *not* unpack the file, but follow the standard procedure for Blender add-on installation:

1. Open [Blender](https://www.blender.org)
2. Go to `Edit > Preferences > Add-ons`
3. Click on `Install`
4. Select the downloaded zip-file `snowflake-*.zip` and click on `Install Add-on`

You are almost done now, but you also need to *enable* the add-on.
To do so, enter ‘Snowflake’ in the search field.
Now click on the small checkbox in front of ‘Object: Snowflake – A snowflake generator for Blender’.

```{note}
We try to support all officially supported Blender versions, that is, the [Blender LTS releases](https://www.blender.org/download/lts) as well as the [latest Blender version](https://www.blender.org/download).
```

For more details on add-ons and their installation, check out the [official Blender documentation about add-on management](https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/latest/editors/preferences/addons.html).
