Welcome to the documentation of the Blender Snowflake add-on!
This add-on simulates snowflake growth based on a physical model.

The model was invented by *Janko Gravner* and *David Griffeath* and presented in their 2007 paper *«Modeling snow crystal growth II: A mesoscopic lattice map with plausible dynamics»* {cite:p}`gravner2008`.

This documentation leads you through the basic usage but also describes the (rather abstract) parameters of the physical model with some examples.
Further, you’ll find the documentation of the implemented Blender operators.
