# Changelog

## Version 1.1.0

- Fix compatibility with Blender 4.1.
- Do not enable auto-smooth automatically, due to a change in Blender’s handling of auto-smooth in version 4.1.
To get the same results as before, just manually apply the [‘Set Smooth by Angle’](https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/4.1/scene_layout/object/editing/shading.html#shade-smooth-by-angle) in Blender 4.1 or enable [‘Shade Auto Smooth’](https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/4.0/scene_layout/object/editing/shading.html#shade-auto-smooth) in Blender versions prior to 4.0.

## Version 1.2.0

- Updated presets documentation with number of simulated steps.
- Show number of total simulated steps of a snowflake in the sidebar (shown number is only correct for files created with version 1.2.0 or newer).

## Version 2.0.0

- Support for Blender 4.3.
- New USD animation export functionality.
- Re-enable auto-smooth functionality on all Blender versions except 4.1.x.

## Version 2.0.1

- Fix: don’t lose material during growth process.
